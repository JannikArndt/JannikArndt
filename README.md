### Hi there 👋

I'm Jannik, I live in Hamburg and enjoy tech.

- 👨‍💻 I work as Chapter Lead & *Scala* dev in the Booking Team at @moia-dev ❤️
- We do some *open-source* there as well, check out [scala-http-client](https://github.com/moia-dev/scala-http-client), or [Scynamo](https://github.com/moia-dev/scynamo/) 🛠
- I used to do *C#* (that's where [Musicista](https://github.com/JannikArndt/Musicista) comes from) and *COBOL* 🕸 (that when I created [Canal](https://github.com/JannikArndt/Canal)), and lots of database stuff, with *MS SQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL*. Also lots of cloud stuff, and _Big Data_ ™️ (I even did [a contribution to Apack Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17832) 🙀). And *Go*. And some *TypeScript*. And lots of *bash* 😂
- My home 🏡 runs on Raspberry Pis with [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) and [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) — 💬 talk to me about it!

#### Life-Pro-Tips

These are mandantory if you want to pair on some code with me

- Get [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) with [Auto-Suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md), [Completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) and [Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattjj/my-oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting).
- Know how to [use git](https://github.com/JannikArndt/git-in-one-image).
- Go for the simple solution first.
